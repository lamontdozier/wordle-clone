# Wordle by Lamont J. Dozier

## Introduction
During the pandemic, the collective attention of scores of people were captured by a single game: Wordle.  The game is deceptively simple: guess a five-letter word within six tries.  If you are able to do so, you win!  If not, you lose.  Almost instantly, people were flocking to the original website to play their daily Wordle, sharing their results on Twitter.  The original game held a place in daily routines almost immediately, similar to the crossword puzzle, the old mainstay.  Eventually, the New York Times bought the game for a seven-figure sum, sending developers into a frenzy to make their own simple game in the hopes of attaining a similar level of virality.

Why did choose to make my own version of Wordle? Well--I like the game.  I was one of those people that played the game daily.  Also, in a previous bootcamp, I attempted to make this game.  I failed lol.  So--this project became personal.  A grudge match if you will.  Could I finally attain enough skill to create my own version of Wordle?

## Game Mechanics
The game mechanics are arguably simple.  Any reputable version of Wordle has the following:
- A 5x6 grid to display the letters
- A functioning keyboard, replete with corresponding colors to help players.
- And subtle animations to add polish.

That's just what the player sees.  There's far more under the hood of this 'simple' game:
- A word list.
- A second word list to check against.
- Functionality to operate the game.
- Extra scripting to allow players to play again.

This was not a walk in the park for me.  I love the look of well-crafted websites.  I had fun with the HTML and CSS aspects of this clone.  The JavaScript, however? Let's just say there was no holiday weekend for me.  Having said that, once bugs are removed, the game isn't impossibly intricate.
